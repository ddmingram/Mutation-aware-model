To run the software, MATLAB 2020a or later is required. There are no specific operating or computing requirements.

All files here should be downloaded to the same folder.

Three types of analysis are provided:
1. MWCM2_GR_z_vary.m - simulation of a single construct, and where calculation of yield and genetic stability is given.
2. MWCM2_repressilator_3state_npop.m - simulation of a three-gene repressilator.
3. MWCM2_toggle_3state_npop.m - simulation of a two-gene toggle switch.

To run any analysis, the individual files should be opened (as labelled in 1., 2. and 3. above), and then 'Run' should be pressed. They each require the various other files that are included in the repository.

Within each core file, the number of states and dimensions being modelled can be modified at the head of the script. This is labelled within.
