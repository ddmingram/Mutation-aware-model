BASIC SET-UP GUIDE

To run the software, MATLAB 2020a or later is required. There are no specific operating or computing requirements. All files here should be downloaded to the same folder.

Three types of analysis are provided, as denoted by the core ".m" file:
1. MWCM2_GR_z_vary.m - simulation of a single construct, and where calculation of yield and genetic stability is given
2. MWCM2_repressilator_3state_npop.m - simulation of a three-gene repressilator
3. MWCM2_toggle_3state_npop.m - simulation of a two-gene toggle switch

To run any analysis, any of the core .m files can be opened in MATLAB (as labelled 1., 2. and 3. above), then 'Run' should be pressed. They each require the various other files that are included in this repository. Within each core .m file, the number of states and dimensions being modelled can be modified at the head of the script. This is labelled within.
